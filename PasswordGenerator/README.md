# Password Generator

This is a simple Python script to generate passwords with user-defined parameters for letters, numbers, and symbols.

## Installation

There's no installation required. Simply clone or download the `password_generator.py` file and run it in your Python environment.

## Usage

Run the script in a Python environment. Upon running, the script will ask for the following:

1. The number of letters desired in the password.
2. The number of numbers desired in the password.
3. The number of symbols desired in the password.

After providing the input, the script generates a password based on the provided criteria and displays it. You can then choose whether to regenerate a new password or exit the script.

## Dependencies

The script has no external dependencies. It uses Python's built-in `random` module for generating random passwords.
